🔍 Violence Reduction Dashboard: Crime Trends & Victim Demographics Analysis
I recently worked on building an interactive analytical dashboard focused on understanding violence trends and analyzing demographic patterns of victims over time.
This dashboard is built to help law enforcement agencies, policymakers, NGOs, and researchers in identifying critical patterns across crime types, age groups, gender, race, and time periods — with the goal of improving public safety and violence reduction strategies.
📊 Key Features & Data Insights:
• 📌 Total Victims Analyzed: 880,838 records
 • 📆 Year with Highest Crime Volume: 2002
 • 📉 Year with Lowest Crime Rate: 2000
 • 💥 Most Common Crime Type: Robbery
 • 🧔 Most Affected Gender: Male
 • 👶 Most Affected Age Group: 0–19 years
 • 🔫 Gunshot Injuries: Distribution by race and time
 • 🏠 Domestic Violence and Juvenile Victimization included as key focus areas
 • 📈 Time Series Trends showing crime variation over different periods
⚙️ Dashboard Functionalities:
✅ Filters for Age Group, Crime Type, Time Period, Gender, Race
 ✅ Charts showing victim count by age, crime type, and gender
 ✅ Race-wise distribution of gunshot injuries
 ✅ Insights into domestic violence and juvenile victimization cases
 ✅ Time-interval visualization to spot crime spikes and declines
🧠 Impact & Use Case:
This dashboard enables decision-makers to:
 • Identify high-risk age groups or genders
 • Allocate resources based on crime seasonality
 • Target community awareness programs
 • Evaluate success of past crime-reduction policies
 • Focus on gun-related crime hotspots by race/time
🛠️ Tools Used:
(Mention here whether it was Power BI / Tableau / Excel / Python / SQL etc. based on what you used)
🙌 I’d love your feedback and suggestions on how this can be improved or scaled for real-world impact.
